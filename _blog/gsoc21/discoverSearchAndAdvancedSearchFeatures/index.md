## Discovery Search and Advanced Search Features

Hi üëã, I am [Yashraj Desai](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yashraj-desai-55a78a1a5/) ! I worked on "Discovery Search and Advanced Search Features" project under CDLI organisation for GSoC '21. 
The project mainly focuses on enhancing the Search and Advanced search features in the CDLI framework and adding new features to it using [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch/) and [CakePHP](https://cakephp.org/).

<i>Proposal</i> : [Discovery search and advanced search features](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WEeNnALSUN4yecCbYxuDyMNUMOzkGcev6Dss4XuNydc/edit#)\
<i>Contributions to CDLI</i> : [Link](https://gitlab.com/cdli/framework/-/merge_requests?scope=all&state=all&author_username=yashrajdesai30)\
<i>Final Report</i> : [Report](https://github.com/yashrajdesai/GSoC-2021-Report/blob/main/README.md#-google-summer-of-code-2021-)

Mentor : [Vedant Wakalkar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/karna98/)

## GSoC Final Report and Summary.
Participating in GSoC was a great learning curve for me, I faced alot of challenges in this journey which helped me in learning new skills.
I shall always be indebted to such a welcoming organisation to help me enhance my coding skills.
