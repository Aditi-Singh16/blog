## Week Summary

Namaste üôè ,    
Welcome to my ninth week blog of GSoC'21 !

### What did you do this week?

This week I completed search sign values permutation objective. I also made the input for inscriptions search flexible so that user can search with both utf8 and ascii characters. I noted down the important features which were to be included in developer and user's documentation, and created seperate issues on it. I also transferred the highlight functions from view to controller and modified it to highlight all sign readings.
