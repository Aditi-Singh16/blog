## Week Summary

Namaste üôè ,    
Welcome to my fourth week blog of GSoC'21 !

### What did you do this week?

This week I integrated the search settings page functionalities with front-end and also I replaced the current curl based implementaion for performing requests with CakePhp HTTP client. We discussed about the abstractization function in jtf-lib and integrating it in the framework and finalised the work-flow for "Search inscriptions with sign value permutation". We also had discussions on ATF Display and on Images and Inscriptions table along with it's filters.
