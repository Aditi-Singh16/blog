## Week Summary

Namaste üôè ,    
Welcome to my fifth week blog of GSoC'21 !

### What did you do this week?

This week I implemented inscriptions search in both simple and advanced search and highlighted matching search inscriptions in full and compact search results page. For implementing this, I had to first index data as latest version of database had new entries in inscriptions table. For processing and highlighting matching search inscriptions, I added functions in search view file to render the inscriptions data accordingly.

### Did you get stuck anywhere?

I had doubts related to rendering processed version of atf data, which I cleared with the help of mentors and taking reference from old working version of CDLI codebase.
