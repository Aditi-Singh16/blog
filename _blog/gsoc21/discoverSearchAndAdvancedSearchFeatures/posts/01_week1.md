## Week Summary

Namaste üôè ,    
Welcome to my first weekly blog of GSoC'21 ! 

### What did you do this week?

After a great community bonding period, I officially started working on my project. This week, I addded the Id's and keywords search fields in simple search and implemented fuzzy queries for both simple and advanced search. I thoroughly tested both these fields with various fuzzy queries configurations and updated the regex according to the requirements.

In this week, I completed 1st and 2nd objectives of my project. 

I also completed my earlier PR [!307](https://gitlab.com/cdli/framework/-/merge_requests/307).

### What is coming up next?

Next week, I will be working on "Enabling search inscription with sign value permutation" objective and also update and improve PR [!317](https://gitlab.com/cdli/framework/-/merge_requests/317) according to feedback from mentors.

### Did you get stuck anywhere?

Yes, I had doubts regarding generating indices using logstash and the current logstash queries in framework. But a short meeting with my amazing mentor cleared all my doubts and got me working again! ‚úå
