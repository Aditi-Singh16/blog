## Week Summary

Namaste üôè ,    
Welcome to my second week blog of GSoC'21 !

### What did you do this week?

This week, I created and optimised PR [!317](https://gitlab.com/cdli/framework/-/merge_requests/317) for fuzzy Id's and keywords field, after thorough testing and feedback from mentors. I also had discussions over "Enabling search incsriptions with sign value permutation" obejctive with mentors. I researched and studied jtf-signlist along with jtf-lib and jtf. I learned about jsonPath query which would be used to extract data from JSON.

### What is coming up next?

Next week, I will try to implement primitive version of "Enabling search incsriptions with sign value permutation" objective by indexing the jtf-data and coding elasticsearch queries for the same.

### Did you get stuck anywhere?

Yes, I had doubts regarding jtf-data and jtf-lib. My amazing mentors provided me with test data to work around which made things clearer to me.
