## Week Summary
This week started with reviewing the PR that was made for the index, view of images table, implemented the changes suggested by the mentors. Once that was done I started to work around the templates of edit page, since we got to know the chnages in folder structure of RTIs I fine tuned to script to handle those exceptions and got the script to review from mentors. Gave a few final touches to the PR [!355](https://gitlab.com/cdli/framework/-/merge_requests/355)
