## Summary
Done with 4 objectives in the first phase of GSoC. Working on creating, dockerizing python script, design pages, standard templates, populating the tables.


## Objectives and Deliverables
| \# | Objectives                    | Associated Deliverables         |
| --- | ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| 1 | Desgin Pages  | Worked on designing the pages which are getting used in my projects. Getting them reviewed from design team and mentors. The design can be found [here](https://www.figma.com/file/jOKep53xdWK6YS6Xqtqoef/CDLI-GSoC-Design?node-id=0%3A1) |
| 2 | Creating, Dockerizing Python Script  | Worked on python script which will help us in dumping necessary information in CSV, due to dependencies differences I was supposed to dockerize the script. |
| 3 | Populating Tables  | The tables were then populated with some test data using our python script which dumped the CSV. |
| 4 | Generate Standard Templates, Controllers | Worked on creating some standard templates, controllers and then fitting our custom methods into it. |


## Learning and Success
I have never used docker, cake php at this large scale, so this was a good learning for me. Since we have used a pyhton script I also got to know more about how python script works and how can we give more freedom to the user by customizing it with different libraries. 

## Difficulties
I faced a few difficulties in docker while I was palnning to put my script in main project folder, cake php conventions were a bit new to me so that took quite a time to catch hold.

## Plan update
I am little bit behind my planned schedule, so I will pacing up and try to cover the objectives that are set for next week.
