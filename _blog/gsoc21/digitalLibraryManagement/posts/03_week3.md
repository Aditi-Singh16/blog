## Week Summary

This week my task was to code a pyhton script which could help us gather all the necessary informations and save it in an json file. Since the json was exceding the limits, i decided with my mentors that csv could be much better option as the data is flat data. After mutilple discussions, reviews i got to know about the folder structure and changes my script to suit the needs.
