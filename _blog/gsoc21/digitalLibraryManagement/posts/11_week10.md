## Week Summary

This week I worked upon the PR [!377](https://gitlab.com/cdli/framework/-/merge_requests/377) had a quick debug session with Nisheal and finished with renaming the asset once the admin changes the type of asset. I also worked upon removing the duplicates if any exists in database, finished up final report and updated the blog.
