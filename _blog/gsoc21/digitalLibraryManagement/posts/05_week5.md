## Week Summary
This week started with issue of SSL Certificates in our server which contains the image, becuse of this issue we were unable to install, setup python libraries. So I worked on creating docker image, container and bind the volumes required for the smooth run of the script. I faced a few issues in binding the volumes which was then sorted out with the help of Nisheal.
