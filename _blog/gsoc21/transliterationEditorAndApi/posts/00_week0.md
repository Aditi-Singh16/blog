##Summary

We had our first meeting with both the mentors. Got to know about each other and CDLI. We decided on the communication plans and how other things will take place. Set clear milestones and primary goals for the projects.
 
Here are few things which I have been learning during this community period.
 * Explored Cake PHP.
 * Brushing out my Docker knowledge.
 * Get to know a bit more about atf & jtf.

We also had our first meeting with mentors for community bonding in this period and discussed CDLI in-depth and got to know about other students and mentors as well.
