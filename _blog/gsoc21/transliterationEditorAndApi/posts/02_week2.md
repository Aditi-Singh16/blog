## Week Summary
This week I have worked on roadblocks that I have been facing for merging the code. I must say we need lint test in docker file as well. 
due to that I have faced pipeline failure which can be solved in a couple of minutes. At last I finally made my PR ready to merge and move
towards to completion of the first objective.
