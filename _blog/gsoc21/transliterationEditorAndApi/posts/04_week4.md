## Week Summary

Continuing work on last week's CORS issue. Had a meeting with Lars about how we can tackle this issue. we agreed on temporary fix by allowing all the origins.
Integrated a Fetch function for fetching ATF by P numbers passed in URL. Also this week there were too many issues and PRs are pending so I have Allocated PR reviews for other members so we can get done with old PRs.
