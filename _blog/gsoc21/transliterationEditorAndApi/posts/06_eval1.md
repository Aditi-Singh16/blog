## Learning and Success

I never experienced docker and cakePHP at this Scale. I have learned docker in depth and brushed my JS. I successfully able to completed tasks releted to docker and containerization.

## Difficulties
I have faced bit difficulties in CakePHP. I never really worked on that part. Creating and handling API is quite tough in this.

## Plan update
I am little bit behind the schedule so I am planning to spend more time on next week so i can ramp up fast and get done with the remaining tasks.
