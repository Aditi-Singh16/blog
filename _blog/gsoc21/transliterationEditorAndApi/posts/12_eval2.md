## Learning and Success
I have learned key things like How NPM dependency work and things to keep in mind while working it as a saprate entity and as a package. 

## Difficulties
I faced some difficulties while working on CakePHP and JTF-lib as a npm package in uqnu.

## Plan update
Storing ATF/JTF in database through uqnu is next on my to-do list and adding more features in uqnu.
