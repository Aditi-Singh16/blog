## Transliterations editor and API

JTF is a new JSON-based format for transliterations that aims to make cuneiform textual data easily accessible for processing and modifications. It comes with a NodeJS API, jtf-lib,to provide an ATF format parser and converter, a CRUD interface and a module for sign list operations, jtf-signlist. A React web application, uqnu, is being developed to import transliterations from files, validate, edit, export etc.

The task is to integrate this infrastructure into CDLI's framework and allow crowdsourcing and individual work on texts.
