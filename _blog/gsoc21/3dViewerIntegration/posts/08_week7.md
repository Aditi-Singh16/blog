## Week Summary

 
This week started pretty relaxingly as I have found a solution for the past week's issue.

Added a link for viewing envelop 3D model if it exists for a particular cuneiform artifact model, and it solved the issue of viewing envelop 3D model.

Also, a basic damping effect was added in 3Dviewer interactions to get a real-world feeling of torque and friction while interacting and rotating the model in 3D viewer.
