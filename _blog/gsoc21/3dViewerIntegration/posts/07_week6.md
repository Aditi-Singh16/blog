## Week Summary

 
Ugh,

This week started with the issue of viewing two models in the 3D viewer for one artifact, because of the issue we were unable to view the cuneiform envelop model of CDLI-ID = P360985.

Parallelly with the search of the solution for the above issue, worked on 3D viewer development documentation and completed it.
