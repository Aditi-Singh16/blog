## Week Summary

 
Fantastic!

Best week ever, this is week 4 of Evaluation 1 and I am done with 50% of the objectives for GSOC'21. It includes :

:point_right: Renadering 3D Models for CDLI data base.

:point_right: Easy to navigation feature between Artifact view and 3D Viewer with associated cuneiform tablets.

This week was full of new learnings and errors coming up with every change in code but at last, all things come up good. :sparkles:
