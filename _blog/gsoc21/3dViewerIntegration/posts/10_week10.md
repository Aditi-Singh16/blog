## Week Summary

Hurray!!!

This is the second last week of GSoC and I am not that away from my deliverables for the second and final evaluation, far away this week:
Focused on enhancing 3D viewer usability.
Also, we have made different forms for the usability surveys.

With the end of this week, I have targets for next to work on user feedbacks to enhance usability.
