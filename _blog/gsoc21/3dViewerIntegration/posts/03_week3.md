## Week Summary

 
AH!,
 
This is 3rd week of the GSoC 10 week journey, I've finished much of my deliverables and doing improvements on it.

For this week was working on the responsiveness of the 3D viewer, which was a challenge for me as 3D Viewer was not just up with CSS also in backend rendering process of the 3D model was happening, so for changing the size of the viewer according to viewport I made a function which on-call resizes width and hight of the viewer. This function was called on every time rendering 3D model.
