## Week Summary

Yes! I did it.

This is the last week of GSoC'21 and my project 3D Viewer Integration is complete to integrate into the CDLI framework. As last week was planned for all testing and debugging things in 3D Viewer,  and with that, I focused on solving all small-small enhancements and got 3D Viewer ready to integrate.
