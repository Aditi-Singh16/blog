## Week Summary

 
I started out first week of the coding period by integration of 3D Viewer to cdli framework in CakePHP and by integration I mean:

:point_right: Getting structure of 3D viewer Page ready.

:point_right: Adding 3D viewer code in framework.

:point_right: Converting the added code to CakePHP friendly.

With a learning curve over CakePHP, docker, and some github command too I was able to complete my first-week deliverable i.e. 3D Viewer up on framework with error in loading 3D models.
