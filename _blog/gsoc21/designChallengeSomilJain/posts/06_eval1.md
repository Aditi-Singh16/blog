## Summary
The first phase was really thrilling and helped me alot to learn. I worked on varoius aspects of Admin as well as user side of frame work, checked for disperancies, dived deeper for research, made mockups,framed the prototypes and redesigned shortcomings discovered in user testing. I have used Useberry for user testing and understanding of user flows and finally helped developers in implementing designs.

## Difficulties
Major difficulty, I felt was on user side web as well as mobile design, because there we had restriction of NO JS users, I designed and improvised them various times to enhance User experience.
