## Week Summary

In the first week of my coding period, I did learn a lot of new things related to docker, created a docker container for ojs by pulling pkp/ojs image and worked on different errors while creating the docker .Besides that, after discussing with my mentor, we took a decision to create ojs container by creating ojs submodule in CDLI.
