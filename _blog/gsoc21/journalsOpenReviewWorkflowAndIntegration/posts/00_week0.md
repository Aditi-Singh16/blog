## Summary

Community bonding the first the phase of Google Summer of Code where we learn more the organization and co-mates.
We had a conference call for the community bonding where I got to know more about other students who are participating for GSoC'2021 and we made plans to sync the project without breaking things.

<li><a href="https://gitlab.com/cdli/framework/-/issues/349">#349</a> - Changed alignment of delete buttons to right</li>

</ul>

We had our first meeting with mentors in this period where we discussed and made final document of milestones, my objectives and deliverables and a precise timeline. I created a workflow for ojs integration into our framework with the help of Somil https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lBQQskE=/
and did research on ojs different features which we can implement in our framework and how to use APIs to share data between two databases.
