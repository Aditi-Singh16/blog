## Week Summary

Hola, this week I completed implementing review page design with navtabs on single article web view. I created relations between ojs models in cdli framework and displayed reviewers endorsements on a route for each ojs submission. Later in the week, I researched about writing commands and created a function to move ojs submissions to cdli journals dashboard once they are reviewed. I created command script move_ojs_to_cdli in cake and run that function created to move ojs submissions to cdli in command and used it to create new entity in articles table in cdli database.
