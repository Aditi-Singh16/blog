## Week Summary

Hola, this week I wrote dockerfile to create ojs container consisting ojs submodule and debug the errors in ojs container. Once the container was running fine, I made few changes to the ojs configuration file so that changes remain persistent on differnt systems. Besides this with Somil, I discussed the final design of single article view and journals dashboard to link ojs. We even decided final journals editorial workflow with Emilie, Jacob and Nisheal.
