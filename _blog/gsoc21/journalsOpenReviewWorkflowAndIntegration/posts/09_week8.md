## Week Summary

Hola, by the end of week 7 single article web view was implemented and database connection was made with the required ojs tables models in cdli framework. 
Initially this week I made single article view dynamic and made changes to it told by emilie. Then I wrote raw sql queries to create relations between ojs tables to extract required data for single article web view. By the end of the week we discussed on using directly models to create relations between tables and extract data. Thus I worked on creating relations between models and implemented review page design in journals web view.
