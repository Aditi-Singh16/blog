## Week Summary

Hola, initially this week I debug all the errors in ojs container and plugins. By the end of this week, I tested the complete ojs editorial workflow, created a test submission following the different processes of author, editor and reviewer. We even discussed journals dashboard workflow to display articles once they are reviewed in ojs.
