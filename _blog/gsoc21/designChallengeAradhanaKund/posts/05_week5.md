## Week Summary

 
I started with adding accordions for js and no-js in the common accordion sass file. Restructured the code for no-js dropdown so as to contain one single code snippet for js and no-js instead of having noscript separately. Also restructured the code for resources page and admin dashboard so as to have a common code for small and large screens . Finally I implemented the 404 page as well as the ABOUT US page .
