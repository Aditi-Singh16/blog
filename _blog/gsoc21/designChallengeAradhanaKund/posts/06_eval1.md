## Learning and Success
Working on this project, I learnt :
- Prper coding styles such that it is optimised and can be understood for later improvisations .
- Managing time between differnt issues .
- Got more grip on git and cakephp. 

## Difficulties
My code worked fine but wasnot optimised . So, I faced difficulty at beginning and then learnt how to write organized code so that it fits for all views in one skeleton . Implemented "MOBILE FIRST APPROACH" and got a proper grip on it .

## Plan update
Further I will be working on extra milestones , like improvising the accessibility of accordions , modifying single artifact view , working on common templates .
