## Week Summary

 
Worked on single artifact web and mobile design view. Fixed the broken header issue, added heatmap to browse page and also wored on making the old accordions behave as new ones. Since admin dashboard, resources page and search results page used the new accordions, changed their layout and made them use the layout of old accordions. Now CDLI uses just one accordion which has enhanced styling and accessibility .
