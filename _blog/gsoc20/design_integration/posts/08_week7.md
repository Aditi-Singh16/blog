## Week Summary

At this momemnt I was fairly done with the deliverables that I promised but one of the vital things i.e. Accessibility was something 
that I was struggling with. After a brief discussion with my mentors I started working this week on Accessibility related issues and 
started looking to UI issues that I can work on
