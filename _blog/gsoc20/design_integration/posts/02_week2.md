## Week Summary
Second week arrives now I see that some pages are loaded with content, my mentors
already thought of this issue and suggested adding a scroll to top helper. PR was made 
for the same, afterwards I started working on the results section of the search page. The 
table layout was very challenging fixing certain portions of the table while the rest are
scrollable was one of the things that I struggled with. Towards the end I found some solutions 
for the deadlocks that I was facing and relevant issues and PR's were made
