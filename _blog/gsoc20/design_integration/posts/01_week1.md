## Week Summary

For the first week I started out with the side navigation bar. Initially I only made
a JS based version of it, later on I was instructed to also add in support for people 
that have disabled JS so I added a NO-script fallback for the same. Midway I made the
PR and did fixes on layout.ctp(core layout of every page in the framework) and proceeded
with minor adjustments in search page
