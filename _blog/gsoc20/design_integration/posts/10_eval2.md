## Summary
Give here an overview of the work accomplished during the past 4 weeks. 
The layout for Advance search, search settings, Image view and Object view page have been successfully added into the framework. All the pages have a minimum accessibility score of WCAG(2.0)-A.

## Objectives and Deliverables
- [x] Generate layout for advance search
- [x] Generate layout for Search settings

## Difficulties
 Code repetetion and confusion with the core concepts of php were quite bothering at first but now I understood core concepts of cakePhp and importance of Helpers

## Plan update
I completed all the tasks mentioned in my proposal, for the third phase I'll be working on the following:
- Close pending issues that are marked `ux&design` or `frontend`
- Complete visualisation of search results on advance search page
- Aim for WCAG-AA accessibility
