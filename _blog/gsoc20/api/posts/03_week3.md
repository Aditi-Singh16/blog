Deliverable: Functional Component and REST API

## Week Summary

This week I worked on making the Bibliography REST API functional. Although the
merge request has not been merged yet, most of the work is completed. The main
thing left to do is wait for an update in the registry image of CakePHP or, either
with changed PHP configuration (`allow_url_fopen`) or an added `php-curl` extension
and an updated CakePHP version.

As for deliverables, the merge request resolves this week's deliverable, as well
as the first week's deliverable (writing API development documentation).

Next week I have exams, so especially at the start of the week I will not be able
to do much. Later, however, I can.
