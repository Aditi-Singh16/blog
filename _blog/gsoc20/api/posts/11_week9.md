Deliverable: Setup search API (search functionality is not complete yet)

## Week Summary

This week started working on the linked data model and mapping the concepts from
the CDLI database to the CIDOC-CRM ontology (ICOM/CIDOC & CIDOC CRM SIG, 2011),
based on suggestions from Chiarcos et al. (2018). Results of this will be presented
in a meeting next week (week 10).

I also worked on reviewing the implementation of the search functionality. For
implementing the API overlay I am awaiting some changes.
