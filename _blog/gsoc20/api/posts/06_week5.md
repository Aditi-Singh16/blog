Deliverable: Functional API for inscriptions and annotations

## Week Summary

This week was mainly taken up by finishing phase one. Since the task of reviewing
merge requests was given priority, I could not really work on new code before
the existing code was merged. Given the deliverable, this means I am behind on
schedule.
