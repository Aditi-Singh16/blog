## Summary
Basic algrithm for processing images, and a novel way to get the framework process things on python runtime.

## Objectives and Deliverables
- Fatcross Algorithm
  - HDR Images PreProcessing
  - HDR Images Background Subtraction
  - HDR Images Alignment
  - HDR Images Basic Preprocessing
- Framework Integration
  - Task Queue
  - File Upload & Task Components



## Learning and Success
Good accuracy with images with even complex backgrounds, the noise in the images are well handled. Learnt unique ways to boost images before processing them leading with better images.

## Difficulties
Integration of python with the framework lead to discovery of chained problems with it like file storage, its not feasible to work ahead neglecting them.

## Plan update
With a good enough HDR processing algorithm by our side, I'll work on flatbeds and in parallel start completing the integration to framework.
