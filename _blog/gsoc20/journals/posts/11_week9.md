## Week Summary

I've passed the second evalutation and the main challenges of my projects are completed the converter works fine but has issues which content framing and desing.
In this milestone-3 I will migrate the data from previous cdli website to the newer one, add unit testing and link publication.

Currently we have completed all the CRUD operations with all types of journals which CDLI hosts.
