## Week Summary
Hola,

We've successfully completed the first week of GSoC. In week 1, we had completed the CDLP & CDLN dashboard for which we got really helpful reviews. This week I worked on those reviews for the first 2 days. Later this week I’ve completed the integration of CKEditor to the framework so now we can use it throughout the codebase. I also implemented MathJax in the journals dashboard which renders critical math equations like: , Oh it doesn’t render here I said you its in the journals dashboard. We have finished the reviews with CDLB & CDLN and we are good to move into CDLJ & CDLB for which will use the same resource with a new tex to HTML converter.

Next week I'll try my best to write and update my blog on a daily basis, with no grammatical errors.
