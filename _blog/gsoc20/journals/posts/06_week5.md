## Week Summary
Hi,

I"ve passed the evaluation-1 and got really meaningfull reviews from my mentor. I've started the milestone 2 of my project earlier and now I'm takeing that on.
The main task in this milestine is to convert the latex file into the cdli html template for that we will be making our own converter competing with overleaf latex editor(Probably). We'll create functions for all the extraction and replacements we have to cover all the posible latex tags.

I'll be working on the same for the next three weeks.
