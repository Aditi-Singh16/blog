## Summary

Community bonding the first the phase of Google Summer of Code where we learn more the organization and co-mates.
We had a conference call for the community bonding where I got to know more about other students who are participating for GSoC'2020 and we made plans to sync the project without breaking things.

I took time to improve the CI/CD and tests for CDLI to make sure it works as expected.
