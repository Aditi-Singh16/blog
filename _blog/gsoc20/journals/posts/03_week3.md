## Week Summary

Hola,

This was the third week of GSoC I've finished much of my deliverables and doing imporvements on the same.
I worked on an issue which I was facing while integrating MathJax and CKEditor with my dashbaord and raised a PR for the same.
Now javascript libraries of vendor folder are more usable.
