## Week Summary

Namaste üôè ,    
Welcome to the second weekly blog of GSoC'20 for CDLI. 

### What did you do this week?

At the start of this week, the final code for Objective-B (Bad Password check) was pushed in MR [!115](https://gitlab.com/cdli/framework/-/merge_requests/115) and successfully merged after review.

The Objective-C (Password retrieval functionality) was implemented as planned and I improvised by adding 2FA to make it more secure before the user sets a new password, implemented after discussion with my mentor.  

The upcoming objective of Role-based access system required the restructuring of the current Database tables which affected the Authentication system. It was the priority task to update code so that framework won't break. The Authentication code was updated according to the new DB structure.

### What is coming up next?

The upcoming week will aim at achieving combined objectives planned for Week 2 and 3.

### Did you get stuck anywhere?

Few docker containers have restricted internet access for security purpose from which arose a problem while attempting to set up email configuration for the password retrieval functionality.  The backend is ready and tested except the email functionality, which will be addressed in buffer week.
