## Week Summary

Namaste üôè ,   
Welcome to the tenth weekly blog of GSoC'20 for CDLI. 

### What did you do this week?

The first task was to fix repeated search results which took another day to figure out the ElasticSearch query and implemented. The next task was to implement a Search Settings Page which will reflect various options to be displayed on the search results page. Search Setting page was a priority task as it can be integrated along with Advanced Search.

Due to recent changes in Model files, registering a new user was not working which was later fixed.

### What is coming up next?

The next week will be focussed on writing an SQL query for advance search index in ElasticSearch and implement the remaining search results options.

### Did you get stuck anywhere?

Removing repeated results, required an extra day to complete this task.
