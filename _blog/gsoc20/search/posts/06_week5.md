## Week Summary

Namaste üôè , 
Welcome to the fifth weekly blog of GSoC'20 for CDLI. 

### What did you do this week?

This week is important since it was time for the evaluation of work done in one month for the project.
So, updated remaining blogs for Week 3, Week 4 and the Evaluation Blog as part of the evaluation. And finally on 4th July results were announced, pretty much excited to pass the 1st GSoC Evaluation. Thanks to my mentor √âmilie Pag√©-Perron.

Out of the remaining days, I took 2 days to rest. It is quite important to take rest to refresh your mind and start working again with the same efficiency as Day 1 of Project.

And then the remaining days were allocated to Access Setup for the framework.

### What is coming up next?

The excitement can be kept aside for now as I have to gear up for upcoming objectives and deliver them as planned. So next week will be focused on setting up and experimenting with Elasticsearch.

### Did you get stuck anywhere?

Not as such.
