Welcome of CDLI Blogs.

This page contains reports made for every week.<br><br>

## Week Summary

This week I added a list view option for the artifacts collection and a search bar property. I focused on adapting some features of the mobile app to iOS platforms, which will be tested later on using Codemagic.<br>

I also worked on getting the CDLI framework locally on my machine, but for some reasons I could not install it. I am still looking into finding a solution for this.<br><br>
