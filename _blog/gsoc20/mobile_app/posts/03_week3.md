Welcome of CDLI Blogs.

This page contains reports made for every week.<br><br>

## Week Summary

This week I installed a Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) 2 in my machine to support Docker Desktop. WSL 2 feature for Windows solved my problem and I could install the CDLI framework and run the site.<br><br>
