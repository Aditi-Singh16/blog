Welcome of CDLI Blogs.

## Week Summary

I focused a bit on the mobile app. Made some changes to the overall structure of the mobile app, added a navigation drawer, an initial screen for first time users, and integrated the app with Firebase to complete a Help & Feedback form. Fixed some issues along the work.<br><br>
