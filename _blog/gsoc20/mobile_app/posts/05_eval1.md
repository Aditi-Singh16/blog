## Summary
During the past 4 weeks, I worked on the mobile app development using Flutter, environment setup for the CDLI framework, and started working on the admin panel. Together with the mentor, we prepared a questionnaire for the mobile app.<br>

The mobile app is almost complete. There are a few features which need to be tested and some minor issues to be fixed. At this point, the app is tested in Android platforms only.<br><br>

## Objectives and Deliverables

## Learning and Success
I am really enjoying working on an open source project. I like that there is always something new to learn. Even though I had some experience with Flutter, I learned a lot more features and how to use them along the project development.<br><br>

## Difficulties
I had some trouble with the CDLI framework installation due to incompatibility of the OS Edition on my machine with Docker Desktop. However, using a Windows Subsystem for Linux (WLS) backend, I managed to host the framework locally with the help of my mentor. Also, working with CakePHP for the admin panel development was a bit challenging for me. Since I have some prior knowledge of PHP, I found it easy to quickly go through a CakePHP tutorial and get the basic idea of how this web framework works.<br><br>
