## Summary
In the past 4 weeks, I was focused on working on the web admin interface for the mobile app data entry and management. The structure of the admin panel is almost complete. There are still a few issues that need to be tested and fixed.<br><br>

## Objectives and Deliverables
|No.|Objective|A short description of the work done|  
|---	|---	|---	|  
|1   	| Admin panel	|Added cdli_tablet table in the DB. Add/Edit/Delete operations on data. Data displayed in a tabular format.   	|  
|2   	| Mobile app 	|Changes in the overall structure of the app. Added a navigation drawer, About and Help & Feedback form (integrating Flutter with Firebase to record user responses). Added highlights.   	|    
<br>

## Learning and Success
During this second working period, I studied and worked with CakePHP at the same time and learned how to include Bootstrap for interface components. I learned how to better manage the mobile app layout in Flutter, rather then just focusing on its functionality.<br><br>

## Difficulties
As the spring semester final exams in my university were held on July this year, I had to work on the project and study for exams at the same time. For this reason, the work with the project development slew down a bit. However, I managed to fulfill most of my objectives for this second working period.<br><br>
