## Revamp CDLI tablet apps (Apple and Android)
The idea of the Revamp CDLI tablet apps project is to recreate the existing CDLI tablet app
using Flutter and provide a web admin interface for the mobile app data entry and management.

highly-customized UX. CDLI tablet app will be accessible for both Android and iOS devices.
