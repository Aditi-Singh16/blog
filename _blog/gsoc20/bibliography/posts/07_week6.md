## Week Summary

For most of this week, I was having issues with saving associated editors along with the publications data. Spent quite a lot of time trying to figure it out by using a number of ways for the connections between the tables. While I finally got it working using a workaround, using it will lead to difficulty in data validation. So, I will be trying to solve this later. Also, decided on changing the design for publications pages to integrate adding authors and editors into the publications pages. Started the work on this as well.
