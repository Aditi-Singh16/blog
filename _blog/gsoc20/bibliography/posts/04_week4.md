## Week Summary

Made a number of changes to bulk upload artifacts-publications features and got it merged. Also, improved the BulkUpload components for easier use for other developers. It can now handle bulk upload for all the tables. Thought it can't save associated tables data, this will be possible when I make changes while working on publications data bulk upload (it requires saving publications data along with saving associated authors and editors).

Completed the publications data pages. Also, decided to redesign the working of authors-publications and editor-publications features to integrate them directly into the publications data add and edit pages. Will be working on this later when the necessary components are available from other PRs.
