## Week Summary

Start of this week, I was mostly travelling and returned home on Wednesday. I worked on completing changes to the artifacts_publications pages. Since it required use of ajax and jquery for the autocomplete feature for bibtexkey, I spent some time learning them. Also, completed most of the work for bulk upload of publications. While the bulk uploading of the publications data is done, saving associated data like authors and editors is being worked on and I will try to complete it next week.
