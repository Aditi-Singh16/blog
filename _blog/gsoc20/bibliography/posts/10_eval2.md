## Learning and Success
Working on these tasks helped me gain a deeper understanding of CakePHP 3 features like its advanced features for saving and retrieving data as well as input forms for the data.

## Difficulties
As the features increased in complexity, I got stuck at various points dealing with some errors. Solving these problems was a good learning experience that helped me gain better understanding of the CakePHP framework.

## Plan update
Based on the remaining time, and considering the priority of the additional tasks, I will most likely have to drop the additional task for linking remaining entities to publications.
