## Learning and Success
Working on the project has been a great learning experience. My mentors have been very supportive and their inputs have been helpful in improving my work. The team meetings give a good overview of the overall progress of the projects. Looking forward to completing the next tasks.

## Difficulties
Since I am new to this field, understanding the data and the table fields has been a bit tough. Though I am trying to understand the database better as the work progresses.

## Plan update
The progress has been good and I am comfortably ahead of my initial timeline. Also, additional task of linking editors and publications was completed during the same time. Considering this, I'm planning to continue my pace and take on some additional tasks.
