## Week Summary

This week, I finished majority of the work for index and view pages for publications. I will be making changes to this design based on feedback. The only thing remaining is sorting the displayed entries based on the last name of the first author (where I am facing some issues) and adding filters which will be handled next week. Also, finised the final bugs and resolved merge conflicts for the publications add/edit and bulk upload features and it is fully ready for merging (review required).
Since I was sick at the start of the week, I couldn't do much for the first three days.
