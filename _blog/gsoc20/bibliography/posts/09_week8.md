## Week Summary

This week started with fixing of errors which were remaining for the bulk upload publications feature. After fixing the bugs, the pages were completed by making the remaining changes for error handling.


Also, the remaining changes to the artifacts_publications pages were made which also included the publications reference display using Bibliography API on all the required pages.
The publications and artifacts data cards are shown below in the image of a sample edit page. Similar information cards were added for add features on the appropriate pages.
