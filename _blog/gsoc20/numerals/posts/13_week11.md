THIS WEEK

## Week Summary

Similar items view supports new data format. Add minor improvements based on discussion with Max: random items button, link to CDLI search from all modules, allow user to click on a word to focus it in the visualization. Many minor bugfixes to prepare for final submission: code no longer hangs during search, fixed computation of median, fixed overlapping UI elements, added clearer description of what info is being displayed, etc.
