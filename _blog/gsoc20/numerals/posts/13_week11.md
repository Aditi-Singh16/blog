## Week Summary

Similar items view supports new data format. Add minor improvements based on discussion with Max: random items button, link to CDLI search from all modules, allow user to click on a word to focus it in the visualization. Many minor bugfixes to prepare for final submission: code no longer hangs during search, fixed computation of median, fixed overlapping UI elements, added clearer description of what info is being displayed, etc. 

Start cleaning and making final round of improvements before submission. Compress URL parameters to allow linking to large corpora without making the URL too long. Formatting updates to make figures have a consistent appearance. Proofread all user-facing text. Remove debug messages. Connect to database in case user requests a text that is not in the precomputed data.
