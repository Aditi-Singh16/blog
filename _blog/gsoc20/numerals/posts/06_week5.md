## Week Summary

Completed basic implementation of most visualization features; implementations are on the dev branch until they are ready to go live. In total, table views are ready for exploring nearby items, descriptors, and examining word use in context; a force-directed graph shows an alternative view of the nearby items and modifiers; and a histogram displays an item's overall distribution alongside summary stats. Visualizations are limited to cardinal counts only, and search only supports single-word queries.

## Daily Work Update

|\#|Day|Date|A short description of the work done|  
|---	|---	|---	|---	|  
|1   	| Monday 	|   2020/06/01	| Implement list of collocations and modifiers (on dev branch). Restructure data format for ease of generating concordance. Implement basic concordance display and fix DataTables column types for proper sorting of numeric values. Implement force directed graph with placeholder data.  	|  
|2   	| Tuesday  	|   2020/06/02	| Implement API to deliver force-directed graph data. Tidy up graph, add panning and scaling, and debug on firefox and chromium. Complete first evaluation.   	|  
|3   	| Wednesday  	|  2020/06/03 	| Canada Day (statutory holiday)  	|  
|4   	| Thursday  	|   2020/06/04	| Meeting. Improve force directed graphs: faster rendering and clearer item positioning. Add UX improvements: dictionary tooltip, clearer link sizing, less overlap between items, resize items to use space more efficiently).   	|  
|5   	| Friday  	|   2020/06/05	| Implement graph for modifiers/adjectives, and add filtering tools to the graph views (filter by term/collocation frequency; options to highlight cliques of closely related items).  	|  
|6   	| Saturday  	|   2020/06/06	|   	|  
|7   	| Sunday  	|   2020/06/07	|   	|
