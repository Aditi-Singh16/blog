## Week Summary

Final round of code cleaning and stability improvements before submission. Update build scripts to use a fixed version of alpine linux in case :latest release breaks something in the future. Make build scripts generate all data before first launch, so there is no need for manual intervention during the install. Zip data for smaller docker images, and host final version of the images on the gitlab docker registry. 

Continued UI improvements to improve readability of figures. Added user guide, updated installation instructions and readme in preparation for submission.
