LAST WEEK - 

## Week Summary

All visualization modules now support filtering by custom corpus. Data format updated to use one data file per document, for faster data generation and easier recovery of P-numbers from the data. Tables now link to CDLI search showing the texts which contain the data displayed in the visualization. All components except similar item view now support the new data format. API load times are much better if the user specifies a small corpus, but still tedious if the corpus is large.
