## Unsupervised Neural Machine Translation for English-Sumerian
Previous models that have been used to carry out English-Sumerian Translation have only made use of the available parallel corpora. [Presently](https://github.com/cdli-gh/Unsupervised-NMT-for-Sumerian-English) we have only about 50K extracted sentences for both languages in the parallel corpora, whereas around 1.47M sentences in the Sumerian monolingual corpus. This huge amount of monolingual data can be used to improve the NMT system by combining it with techniques like Back Translation and Dual Learning which have proved specially useful for Low-Resource languages like Sumerian which have a limited amount of parallel data. Studies on Back Translation have shown that using the synthetic sentences on the source side proves more effective and thus to accomplish English to Sumerian translation, the Sumerian monolingual data can be used extensively. The limitless English monolingual data too can be used to assist Sumerian to English translation, further the two models can be made to complement each other, thus moving onto an Iterative form of Back Translation or Dual Learning.

Recently methods have been proposed to accomplish completely Unsupervised Neural Machine Translation, they rely on Language Modelling and then combining the hidden states of the two LMs. Though they are still very limited to similar language pairs, it would be interesting to experiment with it for our task.

Before moving onto using monolingual data, it would be wise to create a solid baseline by using the self-attention based Transformer architecture purely on the parallel data, first. Moreover, additional techniques like Transfer Learning  wherein weights from a High Resource Language (HRL) Pair are fine-tuned for the Low Resource Language (LRL) Translation have shown considerable improvement in performance and can be employed along with a model like XLM, which hasnâ€™t been tested on such a framework before.
