## Project Overview (Design Integration and Accessibility Audit)
Hi! everyone, My name is Mohit Sharma. I have joined CDLI as an Intern in year 2021. My project is Design Integration and Accessibility Audit. This project will mainly focus on enhancing the Accessibility of website so that people with disabilities can have more interaction with website and can surf freely. To achieve this, the web pages are tested using screen reader and Axe DevTools and to continue this approach in future this project also provide accessibility tests that can be run in the pipeline using [Pa11y-CI](https://github.com/pa11y/pa11y-ci) and [Gitlab CI/CD](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/) which can also be run locally (with proper documentation) so that developer's can check if their code follows [WCAG guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/) before pushing the code to Gitlab. This project also aims to Track non-javascript users using Google analytics and google tag manager, providing framework UI/UX support for Internet Explorer users and developing the new design for Add and Edit forms with advanced features.
